Proxos - Automated Copy Trading Tool
Proxos is an automated trading application that integrates with Google Sheets and Robinhood to execute trades based on target portfolio allocations. The trades are copy traded from signals—specifically, those generated by politicians—allowing users to mirror the investment decisions of public figures they trust.

Features
Google Sheets Integration:
Connects to a Google Spreadsheet that includes:

A Stocks sheet containing columns for Ticker, Company Name, Sector, and Percentage of Portfolio.
An Access Control sheet that lists authorized user emails and access flags.
Automated Trade Execution:
Uses the Robinhood API to adjust your portfolio based on differences between your current allocations and target percentages.

Copy Trading from Politicians:
Designed to follow and copy trades made by politicians, enabling users to align their portfolios with political trading signals.

Scheduling & Auto-Start:
Supports scheduled trading sessions via APScheduler and registers for auto-start on Windows and macOS.

Web Dashboard:
A Flask-based interface provides real-time progress updates, trade summaries, and configuration settings.

Notifications:
Email and SMS alerts (via email-to-SMS gateways) notify users about login approvals, trade summaries, and important system messages.

Session Management & Auto-Updates:
Supports Robinhood session saving, automatic update checking, and a built-in updater.

Google Credentials:
Place your Google credentials file (named credentials.json) in the project root. The application expects this file to authenticate with Google Sheets.

Environment Configuration:
Use the web-based setup (/setup route) or manually create a credentials file (e.g., creds.env) containing your Robinhood username, password, email, phone number, carrier, and other settings.

Configuration
Google Sheets:
The application expects a spreadsheet named "Robinhood Stocks" with:

A Stocks sheet that holds stock tickers and target allocation percentages.
An Access Control sheet that contains user emails and access permissions.
Scheduling:
Trading jobs are scheduled based on a JSON configuration file (schedule_config.json). You can update the trading days and times via the web interface.

Notifications:
SMS notifications are sent using email-to-SMS gateways. Ensure your phone number and carrier are correctly configured.

Usage
Run the Application:

bash
Copy
python main.py
Access the Web Dashboard:
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view progress, update settings, and start trading manually.

Automated Operation:
Proxos will execute trades according to the scheduled times or when manually triggered. It monitors your current portfolio, compares it against target allocations, and uses the Robinhood API to buy or sell fractional shares.

Scenarios Where Proxos is Useful
Copy Trading from Politicians:
For users interested in aligning their investment portfolio with the trading decisions of politicians, Proxos automates the process by copying the trades derived from political signals into your Robinhood account.

Hands-Free Portfolio Rebalancing:
Investors who want to maintain a target allocation without manually monitoring and trading their portfolio can use Proxos to automatically rebalance based on predefined percentages.

Scheduled Trading on Key Dates:
When politicians release key financial or policy updates that affect market conditions, Proxos can be scheduled to execute trades on specific days, capturing potential market movements triggered by these events.

Automated Alerts for Regulatory and Investment Oversight:
With built-in email and SMS notifications, users are kept informed of every trade, ensuring transparency and allowing for quick intervention if needed.

Efficient Portfolio Management:
By automatically managing buy and sell orders based on real-time market data, Proxos reduces manual oversight and ensures your portfolio stays aligned with your investment strategy.
